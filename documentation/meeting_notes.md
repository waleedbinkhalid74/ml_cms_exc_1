# Meeting Notes Excercise 1 - 18-OCt-2021

### Meeting Agenda:
1. Setup github/gitlab
2. Setup overleaf project
3. Go through worksheet and discuss tasks
4. Divide tasks and devise strategy
5. Checkout djikstra for crowds and think of how to model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

## Meeting Notes 21-Oct-2021
1. Fix parser bug: Waleed


## Points to discuss
1. task_4 150 pedestrians too expensive to simulate
2. what is row and col in pedestrian. doesnt seem like coordinates. --> Qais?
3. rimea_1 the time from the gui is 74 seconds. this does not seem correct.
5. rimea_4 is not clear. need to ask professor --> where are the periodic bc??
4. rimea_6 some obstacles get eated away
6. rimea 7, how to give individual speeds?
