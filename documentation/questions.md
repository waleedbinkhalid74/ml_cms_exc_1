## Questions Excercise 1

~~1. Do the diagonals count as neighbors --> Up to us~~
~~2. What happens in the case where more than one cells constitute a target / more than one targets --> Take care of all~~
~~3. Sequence of update? --> Sequential~~
~~4. Considering point 2, the pedestrian will only just wait beside the target and never move into the target. Is this understanding correct.~~
~~5. Can we implement library functions for Dijkstra algo? --> No~~
~~6. github account of prof? How can we provide access?~~
~~7. Work sheet says that if the neighbouring cell is the target the pedestrian waits. But should we not remove the pedestrian~~
8. For task 3 it says the pedestrians should be in a circle at 30-50m. Is this the diameter of the circle? If this is a radius does this mean we can increase the number of cells in the scenario that was given in task 2 (from 50x50 to more) considering one cell is 1m?
9. Cost function given in ws is not good. its only 0.3 when pedestrians are very close. is this a typo? can we use 1/exp(r^2 - r_max ^ 2) 
10. How to model pedestrian dimensions?
11. Should the speed be a parameter? Can we set it to constant for all pedestrians? Should we be required to change it from the gui/cli?
