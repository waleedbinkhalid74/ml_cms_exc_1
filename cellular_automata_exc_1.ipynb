The second method is to execute it by calling the appropriate function and methods in the jupyter notebook environment. In order to show the functionality of the simulator, we will first make use of the pygame GUI. In subsequent tasks, since we wish to show states and specific plots, we will use the jupyter notebook environment to run the simulations.\n",

Finally a GUI will pop up. You can make a scenario there. Type in `P` to add a pedestrian, `O` for object and `T` for target. Please note all of these need to be in **upper case**. If you wish for a cell to remain empty you can leave it as it is. Once you are finished simply close the GUI. The scenario will be saved in a variable for further processing. \n"
